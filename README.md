**lazy-imports-lite** changes the semantics of python imports and defers the import until it is used the first time like in [PEP 690](https://peps.python.org/pep-0690).

I liked the idea of lazy-imports and wanted to use them for my projects without having to change my code.
I hope this project allows more people to use lazy-imports in their projects.

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to note that this project is not affiliated in any way with the original PEP.
> I hope this project allows a wider adoption of lazy-imports, but there is currently no plan to standardize it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **lazy-imports-lite** is still in early development and may contain bugs.
> Make sure that to test your code carefully before you use it.


## Key Features

- lazy imports almost like [PEP 690](https://peps.python.org/pep-0690)
- no code changes required
- can be enabled per module (by keyword in the package)

How is it different to PEP 690?

- It has not the same performance like the implementation from the pep. Every access to parts of imported modules is transformed to an attribute access `x` -> `x.v`.
- Exceptions during deferred import are converted to `LazyImportError`


## Usage

- add `lazy-imports-lite` to your project dependencies.
- add lazy-imports-lite-enabled to the keywords of your `pyproject.toml`.
  ```
    [project]
    keywords=["lazy-imports-lite-enabled"]
  ```

This enables lazy imports for all top level imports in your modules in your project.
One way to verify if it is enabled is to check which loader is used.

``` pycon
>>> import your_project
>>> print(type(your_project.__spec__.loader))
<class 'lazy_imports_lite._loader.LazyLoader'>
```

## Implementation

`lazy-imports-lite` works by rewriting the AST at runtime before the code is compiled.

The following code:
``` python
from foo import bar


def f():
    print(bar())
```

is internally transformed to:

``` python
import lazy_imports_lite._hooks as __lazy_imports_lite__

globals = __lazy_imports_lite__.make_globals(lambda g=globals: g())
bar = __lazy_imports_lite__.ImportFrom(__package__, "foo", "bar")


def f():
    print(bar.v())
```

This transformation should be never visible to you (the original source location is preserved) but it is good to know if something does not work as expected.

You can view a preview of this transformation with `lazy-imports-lite preview <filename>`, if you want to know how your code would be changed.

## TODO

- [ ] windows support
- [ ] handle exec/eval
- [ ] mutable `globals()`
